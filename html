<h1>
Hey There!
</h1>
<p>Bharath Sudarsanam is my name. I attend MLR INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY as a collage student.
    I really believe that the only thing that drove me on was my love for the work that I'm doing. I'm a physics nut, a coding wiz, and a chick cheese.
    Since I am a victim of low-graded collage as well, I have opted to pretend that this is the case rather than accepting the situation as it is.
    In all honesty, nobody would want to be stuck there.I'm a kind of very overthinker like
   What does it signify when someone has made a significant investment in you? 
   They were hopeful that their investments would bear fruit. The most crucial question
   is why would someone want to invest in you. Why were you the sole person who was discouraged 
   by the crowd? Why would no one feel your generosity and instead take advantage of you? 
   Why would anyone assume he's insane? Why the fuck are you the only individual who was 
   publicly humiliated? Why did you always find yourself in a desperate situation? But why
    are you the one who never had a real buddy on whom you could rely? plus a slew of others... 
    Well it depicts my life.</p>
